The app and data gathering together make up the open source project which I am responsible for maintaining. Since my primary duties are focused on maintaining the open source parts of our code I primarily work on reviewing Pull Requests from community members as well as others on the team and doing triage on issues. I also work on code directly such as creating and ensuring our CI pipeline is up to date and maintained not to mention the creation of new parsers so we can add new regions to our app and API. I also help out with shaping and implementing new features that span across the entire code base.",
